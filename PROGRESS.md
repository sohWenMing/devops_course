# DevOps Course -- Agent Relay Progress Tracker

> **How this file works**: Each agent instance reads this file, executes its assigned todo,
> updates the status and work log below, then stops. The user pastes a new prompt into a

## Course Vision (Context for Every Agent)

Build a 10-module project-based DevOps course for a junior developer (OutSystems background, moderate Go, basic Linux, zero cloud experience, Ubuntu machine) transitioning to DevOps/Cloud engineering.

**Golden thread**: A multi-service app called **FlowForge** evolves through every module:
- **api-service** (Go): REST API for task management
- **worker-service** (Go): Background processor polling a PostgreSQL queue
- **PostgreSQL**: Persistent storage
- **Python scripts**: Automation tooling, health checks, deployment helpers

**Progression**: Linux -> Networking -> Go App -> Docker -> AWS -> Terraform -> CI/CD -> Kubernetes -> Monitoring -> Security -> Capstone

**Key principles**:
- Socratic teaching: agent never gives answers outright, asks guiding questions, progressive hints
- Every concept has an exercise (produces artifact) + checkpoint (prove you can do it without notes)
- Debugging challenges in every module (intentionally broken configs)
- Four AI-proof pillars: architecture thinking, debugging under pressure, security instinct, decision frameworks
- AWS free-tier friendly, aligned with SAA certification
- Skills installed to `.cursor/skills/` within the project workspace for Socratic mentoring per module (NOT ~/.cursor/skills/)

**Workspace root**: The project lives at the workspace root (wherever the agent's working directory is).

Start creating Module 1 files inside `curriculum/module-01-linux/`. Remember to install the Socratic mentor skill to `.cursor/skills/devops-m01-linux-mentor/`.

### Todo #1: module-01
- **Status**: completed
- **Files created**:

- **Notes for next agent**: Module 1 is complete with all 9 files. Lab format: clear objectives, step-by-step structure (what to do, NOT how), expected outcomes, checkpoint questions. The README theory guide uses a consistent pattern: concept explanation -> architecture thinking box -> link-forward callout -> AWS SAA tie-in. The broken server lab (Lab 05) has the student create their own break-server.sh script with 5 misconfigurations across permissions, systemd, disk, config, and user/group domains -- then close the script and debug. The answer key contains a sample break-server.sh implementation and full solutions. The skill file includes progressive hint examples for each lab, documentation URLs (man pages, Ubuntu docs, GNU Bash manual, FHS spec), and a common mistakes map with guiding questions. For Module 2, follow the exact same file structure and patterns.

### Todo #2: module-02
- **Status**: completed
- **Files created**:
  - `curriculum/module-02-networking/README.md` -- Theory guide covering: OSI model & TCP/IP stack, IP addressing & subnets, DNS resolution, HTTP deep dive, ports & sockets, firewalls (iptables/ufw), routing & gateways, load balancing concepts, TLS/SSL.

  - `curriculum/module-02-networking/lab-04-broken-network.md` -- Debugging challenge: multi-layered broken network with issues spanning DNS, firewall rules, routing, port binding, and TLS certificates. Requires OSI layer identification for each issue.
  - `curriculum/module-02-networking/checklist.md` -- Exit gate with all checkpoints from the plan, organized by topic area (OSI/TCP, subnets, DNS, HTTP, ports, firewalls, routing, load balancing, TLS, debugging, integration). Binary yes/no.
  - `.cursor/skills/devops-m02-networking-mentor/SKILL.md` -- Socratic mentor skill with lab-specific guidance for all 10 exercises, documentation links (man pages for tcpdump/dig/curl/ss/iptables/openssl, RFCs, nginx docs, Mozilla HTTP reference, DNS visual guides), common mistakes map with 10 entries, architecture thinking prompts, and cross-module connections to Modules 1, 4, 5, 8, 10.
  - `.cursor/skills/devops-m02-networking-mentor/references/answer-key.md` -- Complete solutions, expected outputs, and detailed explanations for all 10 exercises plus the broken network challenge (including example break-network.sh script with 5 deliberate breaks and full solutions with cleanup commands).
- **Notes for next agent**: Module 2 is complete with all 8 files. Lab format follows the same pattern as Module 1: clear objectives, step-by-step structure (what to do, NOT how), expected outcomes, checkpoint questions. The README theory guide uses the established pattern: concept explanation → architecture thinking box → link-forward callout → AWS SAA tie-in. New additions for Module 2: link-back references to Module 1 concepts (e.g., /etc/ from FHS, background processes, sudo). The broken network lab (Lab 04) adds OSI layer identification to the incident report format -- students must identify which layer each problem exists at. The answer key includes a full example break-network.sh implementation with 5 breaks (DNS corruption, firewall DROP rule, removed route, port conflict, wrong TLS certificate) and complete solutions plus cleanup. The skill file maps every Lab 03/04 concept to future AWS (Module 5), Docker (Module 4), and Kubernetes (Module 8) equivalents. For Module 3, follow the exact same file structure and patterns. Module 3 also needs starter code scaffolding in the project/ directory.

Binary yes/no.
  - `project/README.md` -- Project structure guide explaining the FlowForge architecture, directory layout, getting started instructions, environment variables, and future module evolution
  - `project/api-service/go.mod` -- Go module definition for api-service
  - `project/api-service/main.go` -- Minimal skeleton with TODOs for each lab exercise (compiles, serves basic /health, but no real implementation)
  - `project/worker-service/go.mod` -- Go module definition for worker-service
  - `project/worker-service/main.go` -- Minimal skeleton with TODOs for each lab exercise (compiles, blocks forever, but no real implementation)

- **Notes for next agent**: Module 3 is complete with 17 files. This module is unique because it also creates starter code in the `project/` directory -- the Go skeletons compile but don't do anything useful, and the Python scripts have docstrings and TODOs but no implementation. The `.gitkeep` files in `project/api-service/`, `project/worker-service/`, and `project/scripts/` have been replaced with actual starter files. Lab format follows the same pattern as Modules 1-2: clear objectives, step-by-step structure (what to do, NOT how), expected outcomes, checkpoint questions. New additions for Module 3: link-back references to both Module 1 (SIGTERM/SIGKILL, processes, systemd) and Module 2 (TCP connections, ports, ss command, HTTP). The checklist includes integration/architecture thinking items that connect to future modules (Docker, K8s, monitoring). The answer key includes complete Go code samples, SQL schemas, Python scripts, and testing examples. For Module 4, follow the exact same file structure and patterns. Module 4 (Docker) will reference the FlowForge services built in Module 3 -- students will write Dockerfiles for both Go services, create docker-compose.yml, and learn container networking/volumes/security.

### Todo #4: module-04

- **Notes for next agent**: Module 4 is complete with 9 files. Lab format follows the same pattern as Modules 1-3: clear objectives, step-by-step structure (what to do, NOT how), expected outcomes, checkpoint questions. The README theory guide uses the established pattern: concept explanation → architecture thinking box → link-forward callout → AWS SAA tie-in, plus link-back references to Modules 1-3. Key additions for Module 4: containers build directly on Module 1 (namespaces, permissions, processes) and Module 2 (networking, DNS, subnets), and the 12-Factor config from Module 3 is validated as working perfectly for containerization. The labs progress from understanding containers (Lab 01) through optimization (Lab 02), connecting services (Lab 03), orchestrating with Compose (Lab 04), to security and debugging (Lab 05). The debugging challenge in Lab 05 has 4 distinct failure categories matching the plan. The answer key includes complete docker-compose.yml, dev override, .air.toml, multi-stage Dockerfiles, and full debugging walkthroughs. For Module 5 (AWS), follow the exact same file structure and patterns. Module 5 will reference the Docker images built in Module 4 -- students will push them to ECR and run them on EC2/ECS.

### Todo #5: module-05

- **Notes for next agent**: Module 5 is complete with 11 files. Lab format follows the same pattern as Modules 1-4: clear objectives, step-by-step structure (what to do, NOT how), expected outcomes, checkpoint questions. The README theory guide uses the established pattern: concept explanation → architecture thinking box → link-forward callout → AWS SAA tie-in, plus link-back references to Modules 1-4. Key additions for Module 5: Lab numbering starts at Lab 00 (account setup) through Lab 05 (cleanup).

Key additions for Module 10: heavy link-back to Module 5 (IAM policies, security groups), Module 7 (CI/CD pipeline, OIDC), Module 8 (K8s Secrets, ServiceAccounts, NetworkPolicies), and Module 9 (monitoring as detection layer for security incidents). The labs progress from understanding threats (Lab 01) through implementing controls (Labs 02-04) to responding to incidents and auditing the system (Lab 05). The answer key includes complete IAM policy JSON, Terraform configs, ESO manifests, NetworkPolicy YAML, RBAC manifests, pipeline YAML, and incident response runbook templates. The .gitkeep file in `curriculum/module-10-security/` has been replaced with actual content files. For the Capstone, follow the exact same pattern for the mentor skill. The Capstone is a test, not a tutorial -- it provides requirements and acceptance criteria only, with zero guidance. The student must apply everything from Modules 1-10.

### Todo #11: capstone
- **Status**: completed
- **Files created**:
  - `curriculum/capstone/README.md` -- Full capstone requirements document. NOT a tutorial -- a test. Includes: overview (deploy FlowForge as a fully automated, monitored, secured production system), 7 deliverables table (Infrastructure/Terraform, Containerization/Docker, CI/CD/GitHub Actions, Orchestration/Kubernetes, Monitoring/Prometheus+Grafana, Security, Documentation) each with detailed acceptance criteria, 4-part exit gate (stranger test: clone repo + terraform apply + GitHub Actions = running production; break-and-recover: kill a pod, spike traffic, revoke a secret and detect+recover using monitoring and runbooks; interview presentation: architecture decisions and trade-offs; security audit: zero unaddressed HIGH/CRITICAL findings), module cross-reference table mapping each deliverable back to all 10 modules, suggested 5-day timeline, and explicit statement that no step-by-step guidance is provided.
  - `curriculum/capstone/rubric.md` -- Self-grading rubric with 4 scoring levels (Exceeds Expectations: 4, Meets Expectations: 3, Needs Improvement: 2, Not Attempted: 0) for all 7 deliverables plus all 4 exit gate challenges. Detailed criteria for each level for each deliverable. Total score out of 44 with 5-level interpretation (Production Engineer 40-44, Capstone Complete 33-39, Almost There 22-32, Needs More Work 11-21, Start Over 0-10).
  - `.cursor/skills/devops-capstone-mentor/SKILL.md` -- Socratic mentor skill customized for the Capstone. Provides EVEN LESS guidance than module mentors. Only clarifies requirements (not how to implement), offers encouragement, asks architecture thinking questions, points students back to relevant modules, and validates completed work. Does NOT provide implementation hints or code -- not even with the "just tell me the answer" escape hatch. Includes architecture thinking questions for all 7 deliverable areas, module reference table with links to all 10 module READMEs, and documentation links to all relevant docs (AWS, Terraform, Docker, GitHub Actions, K8s, Prometheus, Grafana, Loki, security tools, SRE book, 12-Factor).
  - `.cursor/skills/devops-capstone-mentor/references/answer-key.md` -- Complete expected architecture and evaluation criteria. Contains: full ASCII architecture diagram showing all components, complete Terraform module structure (7 modules: vpc, security-groups, eks, database, ecr, secrets, s3 with full directory layout and key HCL configs), complete Docker configuration (multi-stage Dockerfiles for both services, .dockerignore, docker-compose.yml for local dev), complete CI/CD pipeline YAML (ci-cd.yml with test/lint/security-scan/build-push/deploy-staging/deploy-production jobs, terraform.yml with plan-on-PR and apply-on-merge), complete K8s manifest set (namespace, configmap, ESO ExternalSecret, Deployments with security contexts/probes/resources, Services, Ingress with ALB annotations, NetworkPolicies with default-deny + per-service allow, RBAC with ServiceAccounts/Roles/RoleBindings), Prometheus/Grafana configs (Go instrumentation code, prometheus.yml scrape config, alerting rules for HighErrorRate/HighLatency/WorkerQueueGrowing, SLO PromQL expressions, SLO targets with error budgets), security controls checklist (IAM/secrets/containers/K8s/encryption/CI-CD/incident response), documentation templates (architecture diagram expected content, deployment runbook sections, monitoring guide sections, security audit report format), and exit gate expected evaluation for all 4 challenges.
- **Notes for next agent**: Capstone is complete with 4 files. The .gitkeep file in `curriculum/capstone/` has been replaced with actual content files. The capstone follows a completely different pattern from the 10 modules: it has NO labs, NO exercises, NO theory guide. It is a pure requirements document with acceptance criteria + a rubric. The mentor skill is also fundamentally different: it never provides implementation hints, even when explicitly asked. It only clarifies requirements, asks architecture questions, offers encouragement, and validates completed work. The answer key is comprehensive but is NEVER revealed to the student. For Todo #12 (skills-index), create `.cursor/skills/SKILLS_INDEX.md` listing all 11 DevOps mentor skills (m01 through m10 + capstone) with descriptions and file paths.

### Todo #12: skills-index
- **Status**: completed
- **Files created**:
  - `.cursor/skills/SKILLS_INDEX.md` -- Index of all 11 Socratic mentor skills installed during the course. Lists each skill name, one-line description, file path relative to workspace root, and module/section covered. Also documents the skill directory structure, the progressive hint teaching approach, and links to related files (AGENTS.md, curriculum/overview.md, README.md).
- **Notes**: All 11 skill SKILL.md files were verified to exist before listing: devops-m01-linux-mentor, devops-m02-networking-mentor, devops-m03-goapp-mentor, devops-m04-docker-mentor, devops-m05-aws-mentor, devops-m06-terraform-mentor, devops-m07-cicd-mentor, devops-m08-kubernetes-mentor, devops-m09-monitoring-mentor, devops-m10-security-mentor, and devops-capstone-mentor.

## Course Complete

All 13 todos (scaffold + 10 modules + capstone + skills index) are now **completed**. The DevOps & Cloud Engineering course curriculum is fully built:

- **10 modules** (Linux, Networking, Go App, Docker, AWS, Terraform, CI/CD, Kubernetes, Monitoring, Security) with theory guides, hands-on labs, exit-gate checklists, and Socratic mentor skills with answer keys
- **1 capstone** with requirements, rubric, and a capstone mentor skill
- **1 skills index** cataloguing all 11 mentor skills
- **Global teaching rules** enforced by AGENTS.md
- **Starter code** scaffolded in the project/ directory (Go services, Python scripts, AWS cleanup script)
- **Curriculum overview** with full exercise tables and time estimates

The course is ready for the student to begin at Module 1.

# Module XX: TOPIC -- Socratic Mentor

## When to use this skill

Use when the student says things like:
- "I'm stuck on module XX"
- "help with TOPIC lab"
- "hint for lab-XX"
- "I don't understand CONCEPT"
- Any question related to TOPIC concepts

## How this skill works

You are a Socratic mentor. You NEVER give direct answers. Instead:

### Progressive Hint System

**Level 1 -- Reframe as a question**:
Ask the student a question that guides them toward the answer.
Example: Student asks "How do I list running processes?"
You respond: "What Linux commands do you know that show information about what's currently happening on the system? Think about what 'process' means in the context of an operating system."

**Level 2 -- Point to documentation**:
Direct the student to a specific documentation URL and section.
Example: "Take a look at the `ps` man page, specifically the section on selecting processes. Try `man ps` and read about the `-aux` flags. What does each flag do?"

**Level 3 -- Narrow hint**:
Give a more specific hint but still don't give the full answer.
Example: "You're very close. The command starts with `ps` and you need flags that show ALL users' processes in a USER-friendly format. Try combining flags and see what output you get."

**Direct answer**: Only if the student explicitly says "just tell me the answer" or has been through all 3 levels.

### Validation Before Moving On

Before confirming the student can move on, ask:
1. "Can you explain WHY this works, not just WHAT you did?"
2. "What would happen if [variation]?"
3. "Could you do this again from scratch without looking at your notes?"

## AGENTS.md Template (Created During Scaffold)

```markdown
# DevOps Course -- Agent Rules

## Identity

You are a Socratic DevOps mentor. Your student is a junior developer learning DevOps
through a project-based course built around a multi-service Go application called FlowForge.

## Core Teaching Rules

1. **NEVER give direct answers** to lab or exercise questions. Ask guiding questions first.
2. **Progressive hints**: Level 1 (reframe as question) -> Level 2 (point to docs) -> Level 3 (narrow hint).
3. **Only give direct answers** when the student explicitly says "just tell me the answer" OR has been stuck through all 3 hint levels.
4. **Encourage experimentation**: Say "What happens if you try X?" instead of "Do X".
5. **Celebrate failure**: When something breaks, say "Great! Now we have something to debug. What's the first thing you'd check?"
6. **Architecture thinking**: Regularly ask "Why did you choose this approach?" and "What are the trade-offs?"
7. **Connect concepts**: Always link the current topic to previous modules. "Remember when you did X in Module Y? This is the same concept, but now at the Z level."

## When the Student Asks for Help

1. First, ask what they've already tried
2. Ask what error message or behavior they're seeing
3. Apply the progressive hint system
4. Validate understanding before confirming the answer

## Course Structure

The student is working through curriculum/ modules sequentially.
Each module has a README.md (theory), lab-XX files (exercises), and a checklist.md (exit gate).
The corresponding Socratic skill in .cursor/skills/ (project-local) provides lab-specific guidance.

## What You May Do Directly (No Socratic Method Needed)

- Explain theory concepts from README.md files (these are teaching material, not exercises)
- Help with tooling/environment setup issues (installing packages, fixing PATH, etc.)
- Clarify exercise requirements (what the lab is asking, not how to do it)
- Review completed work and give feedback
```

## Module Detail Reference

The full exercise/checkpoint tables for each module are in the plan file at:
`~/.cursor/plans/devops_course_curriculum_23d38ba5.plan.md`

Each agent should read that plan file to get the detailed exercise tables for its assigned module.
